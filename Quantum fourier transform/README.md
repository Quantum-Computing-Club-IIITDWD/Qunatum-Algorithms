### QUANTUM FOURIER TRANSFORM

- Imagine Alice and Bob are friends and Alice wants to share a message only with Bob secretly, also worried that Eve would intercept in between and can know what the message says. So, what is the solution we can suggest to Alice?

-  Here is a real-time application of the need for encryption that leads to a new field called cryptography. It includes Symmetric Key Cryptography (A single key), Public Key Cryptography (A public Key for encryption and A private key for decryption), The RSA Cryptosystem (An advanced method of Public Key Cryptography) in which the algorithm complexity is polynomial time and so on.

- Classical Cryptography uses the ‘hardness’ of certain mathematical problems but in Quantum angle and according to its principles we have a no-cloning theorem that helps us do significantly efficient algorithm in which even moving a single qubit will make an impact in measurement, allowing us to know whether the encryption is being cracked by a third party or not.

- Quantum attacks can also be powerful enough to render classical cryptosystems obsolete, Shor’s algorithm which can factorize an integer on a ‘feasible’ quantum computer in polynomial time. So, it can easily crack the RSA Cryptosystem, right?

- Its main building blocks Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) can crack most of the cryptosystems some of them being the most implemented Diffie-Helman key exchange and Elliptic Curve Digital Signatures.

- So let us look into the algorithm of QFT and also apply its inverse i.e., encrypting and decrypting the message basically. Inverse QFT here means applying the same gates in the reverse format in order to make it neutralized and show the initial measurements of the qubits when measured.

- For example, we take |0> and |1> states as the initial measurements of qubits and apply QFT followed by inverse QFT, we should get |0> and |1> as the measurement values of the result. 

- For that let us understand the two-qubit system and based on which we can derive the code for the three-qubit system.

- Generally, say |Z> is the integer representation like 7,3, or 2 and is given by the formula
